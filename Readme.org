* Chip8 Suite

Emulator and assembler for the Chip8.

See notes taken through the development in [[file:Notes.org][Notes.org]]

** To-Do

The entire instruction set of the Chip-8 is implemented now, the following items
are pending:
- Fix the delay timer, make things run better? to make it playable, basically
- A Chip-8 assembler (so you can make games)
- A Chip-8 disassembler (so you can read other people's games)
- A Chip-8 debugger (maybe this is too much?)
